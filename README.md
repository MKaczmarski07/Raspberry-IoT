## About The Project

**Thesis title:** <i>Design and implementation of a smart home management platform</i> <br/>
The main goal of the project is to develop a comprehensive and user-friendly smart home management platform, offering seamless control and automation of various interconnected devices within a domestic environment. The project assumes creation of a low-budget model using a set of sensors and actuators simulating the operation of real home devices. In addition to the electronic model, the scope of work includes the entire ecosystem based on the Raspberry PI microcomputer, responsible for collecting, processing and displaying data to the user and enabling remote control of automation systems using an cross-platform application.


## Features
- Home arming function - turning on the motion sensor and detecting intrusions
- Sending notifications when an intrusion is detected
- Measuring temperature and humidity in a room and presenting the collected data in the form of graphs
- Remote control of the servo mechanism representing automatic blinds
- RGB lighting with the ability to set any color and brightness from the application
- Various lighting scenes
- Displaying current and forecast weather data based on the weather api

## Setup the Raspberry Pi

### First steps
The first step is to upload the Raspberry  Pi OS image to the SD card. This can be easily done using the [Raspberry Pi Imager](https://www.raspberrypi.com/software/) tool available on the official website.

After installing the system and initial configuration, you can connect to the microcomputer wirelessly using SSH. In the terminal on your computer, enter:

```
  ssh username@ipAddress
  password
```
Where the first part corresponds to the user account, and the second part is the IP address of the raspberry in the local network. The default user is "pi" and the default password is "raspberry".

### Safe shutdown
The raspberrypi microcomputer should not be turned off by immediately disconnecting the power supply, as this may damage the system or the SD card. To safely turn off your device, in the raspberry terminal, enter
```
  sudo shutdown -h now
```
And wait until the green LED on the raspberry stops blinking
